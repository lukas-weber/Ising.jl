# if you run on a cluster, you need to specify the time your job is allowed to run.
# that is the walltime.
# Loadleveller has to stop before that happens. However, doing sweeps and writing
# out all the data takes a finite amount of time, especially for big simulations.
# Therefore it is good to leave a generous safety window between the time loadleveller
# starts thinking about stopping (mc_runtime) and the time when it will be killed by
# somebody else (mc_walltime). If it gets killed while writing out data in rare circumstances,
# measurement files might get corrupted.
